# 0x11. C - printf

*The project requires the team to write their own version of the printf function. The project expects the team to have a good understanding of Group Projects, Pair Programming - How To, Flowcharts, and Technical Writing concepts. The team is not allowed to use global variables and must have no more than 5 functions per file. The prototypes of all the functions should be included in a header file named main.h.*

*The project requires the use of allowed functions and macros such as write, malloc, free, va_start, va_end, va_copy, and va_arg. The code will be compiled using gcc with the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89. All files should end with a new line, and there should be a README.md file at the root of the folder of the project. The code should use the Betty style, which will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl. All header files should be include guarded.*

*The project requires the team to have one project repository per group. The other members do not fork or clone the project to ensure only one of the team has the repository in their Github account, otherwise, the team risks scoring 0%.*
