# 0x11. C - printf

*The project requires the team to write their own version of the printf function. The project expects the team to have a good understanding of Group Projects, Pair Programming - How To, Flowcharts, and Technical Writing concepts. The team is not allowed to use global variables and must have no more than 5 functions per file. The prototypes of all the functions should be included in a header file named main.h.*
