# 0x11. C - printf

*The project requires the implementation of a printf function in C programming language. Concepts related to the project are Group Projects, Pair Programming, Flowcharts, and Technical Writing.*

*The project involves writing a custom implementation of the printf function in C. The project has several requirements, such as using the Ubuntu 20.04 LTS operating system, the gcc compiler with specific options, writing code in the Betty style, using no global variables, and having no more than 5 functions per file. Additionally, the prototypes of all functions should be included in the main header file, which should be included guarded. Finally, the project must be pushed to a GitHub repository, which should be created by one member of the team, and the other member should not fork or clone the repository.*
